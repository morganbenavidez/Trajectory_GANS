# Trajectory_GANS

## Overview

This repository contains code for a Trajectory Generative Adversarial Network (Trajectory GAN) implemented in Python. The project is designed to run on Manjaro Linux with Python version 3.11.6. It should work on other Linux distributions as long as the Python version matches.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your machine:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Navigate to your preferred directory (e.g., `Downloads`):
    ```bash
    cd Downloads
    ```

3. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/morganbenavidez/Trajectory_GANS.git
    ```

4. Change into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Trajectory_GANS
    ```

5. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

6. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

7. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

This process will create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies for the Trajectory GAN project.

## Usage

Now that the project is set up, you can proceed with using the Trajectory GAN. Follow the instructions in the project documentation for running and experimenting with the code.

## Note

Make sure that your system matches the specified Python version (3.11.6) for compatibility. The instructions assume that you have Git, Python, and virtualenv installed on your machine.

This repository contains code for a Trajectory Generative Adversarial Network (Trajectory GAN) implemented in Python. The project is designed to run on Manjaro Linux with Python version 3.11.6. It should work on other Linux distributions as long as the Python version matches.

OS: Manjaro Linux
Release: 23.1.0
Python Version: Python 3.11.6
(Should work on other Linux versions as long as Python version is the same as project is contained in a virtual environment)

Open Terminal:
cd Downloads
git clone https://github.com/morganbenavidez/Trajectory_GANS.git
cd Trajectory_GANS
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will create a virtual environment and install all of the dependencies in requirements.txt into your virtual environment.
